# AIC MuJoCo Integration

This package provides documentation, scripts, and utilities for loading the AI for Industry Challenge (AIC) environment in MuJoCo.

## Overview

[MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) is a physics engine designed for research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation. In collaboration with **Google DeepMind**, this integration enables participants to:

- Convert Gazebo SDF worlds to MuJoCo MJCF format using `sdformat_mjcf`
- Load the AIC task board and robot from exported Gazebo worlds (`/tmp/aic.sdf`)
- Access camera images, joint states, FT sensor data, and command the simulated robot over the same ROS topics
- Collect data and run policies unchanged between Gazebo and MuJoCo

This guide is split into two independent parts:

| | What | ROS 2 Control needed? |
|---|---|---|
| [**Part 1**](#part-1-building-the-mujoco-scene) | Generate the MJCF scene from Gazebo and view it in MuJoCo | No |
| [**Part 2**](#part-2-mujoco-with-ros-2-control) | Run the scene with `ros2_control` (same controller interface as Gazebo) | Yes |

## Import MuJoCo Dependencies

From your ROS 2 workspace, import all required MuJoCo repositories:

```bash
cd ~/ws_aic/src
vcs import < aic/aic_utils/aic_mujoco/mujoco.repos
```

This adds:
- `gz-mujoco` (with `sdformat_mjcf` tool) — Converts Gazebo SDF files to MuJoCo MJCF format
- `mujoco_vendor` (v0.0.6) — ROS 2 wrapper for MuJoCo 3.x with plugins (elasticity, actuator, sensor, SDF) and the `simulate` binary
- `mujoco_ros2_control` — Integration between MuJoCo and ros2_control

---

## Part 1: Building the MuJoCo Scene

This section covers generating and viewing the AIC scene in MuJoCo **without** requiring `ros2_control`. You only need the `sdformat_mjcf` converter and a MuJoCo viewer.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install `sdformat_mjcf` Python Bindings

The `sdf2mjcf` CLI tool requires Python bindings for SDFormat and Gazebo Math that are **not** resolved by `rosdep`. Install them from the OSRF Gazebo apt repository:

```bash
# Add the OSRF Gazebo stable apt repository (if not already added)
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update

# Install required Python bindings
sudo apt install -y python3-sdformat16 python3-gz-math9
```

Verify the bindings are importable:

```bash
python3 -c "import sdformat; print('sdformat OK')"
python3 -c "from gz.math import Vector3d; print('gz.math OK')"
```

#### 2. Build the Converter

Build the `sdformat_mjcf` package:

```bash
cd ~/ws_aic
source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select sdformat_mjcf
source install/setup.bash
```

### Scene Generation Workflow

#### 1. Export from Gazebo

- Launch `aic_gz_bringup` with your desired domain randomization parameters. For example:
```bash
ros2 launch aic_bringup aic_gz_bringup.launch.py spawn_task_board:=true spawn_cable:=true   cable_type:=sfp_sc_cable   attach_cable_to_gripper:=true   ground_truth:=true
```
- Gazebo will export the world to `/tmp/aic.sdf`.

See [Scene Description](../../docs/scene_description.md) for more details.

#### 2. Fix Exported SDF

The exported `/tmp/aic.sdf` contains two known URI corruption issues that must be fixed before conversion.

##### Issue 1: `<urdf-string>` in mesh URIs

When models are spawned from URDF strings (via `ros_gz_sim create -string`), the SDFormat parser uses the placeholder path `<urdf-string>` as the file source. On world export, this leaks into mesh URIs as `file://<urdf-string>/model://...`, which breaks XML parsing because `<urdf-string>` is interpreted as an XML tag.

```bash
# Fix corrupted model:// URIs
sed -i 's|file://<urdf-string>/model://|model://|g' /tmp/aic.sdf
```

##### Issue 2: Broken relative mesh URIs

Some included models (SC Plug, LC Plug, SFP Module) use relative mesh URIs (e.g., `<uri>sc_plug_visual.glb</uri>`). When the world is exported, these lose their model-relative context and become root-path URIs like `file:///sc_plug_visual.glb`, which point to nonexistent files.

```bash
# Fix broken mesh URIs by pointing to the actual files in aic_assets
sed -i 's|file:///lc_plug_visual.glb|model://LC Plug/lc_plug_visual.glb|g' /tmp/aic.sdf
sed -i 's|file:///sc_plug_visual.glb|model://SC Plug/sc_plug_visual.glb|g' /tmp/aic.sdf
sed -i 's|file:///sfp_module_visual.glb|model://SFP Module/sfp_module_visual.glb|g' /tmp/aic.sdf
```

> **Note:** These issues originate in the SDFormat library's handling of string-parsed URDFs and relative URIs during world save. They will occur every time you re-export the world from Gazebo.

#### 3. Convert SDF to MJCF

- Use the `sdf2mjcf` CLI tool to convert the fixed `/tmp/aic.sdf` to MJCF format:
  ```bash
  source ~/ws_aic/install/setup.bash
  mkdir -p ~/aic_mujoco_world
  sdf2mjcf /tmp/aic.sdf ~/aic_mujoco_world/aic_world.xml
  ```
- This generates MJCF XML file and mesh assets in `~/aic_mujoco_world`.

#### 4. Organize MJCF Files


- You **must always**  copy or symlink the generated mesh assets (`.obj` and `.png` files) from `~/aic_mujoco_world` into the `mjcf` folder so MuJoCo can find them.
  ```bash
  cp ~/aic_mujoco_world/* ~/ws_aic/src/aic/aic_utils/aic_mujoco/mjcf
  ```

#### 5. Generate Final MJCF Files

The `sdformat_mjcf` converter produces a single monolithic MJCF file. The `add_cable_plugin.py` script splits and refines it into separate robot/world/scene files and applies corrections that the converter cannot handle automatically:

- **Splits into three files:** Separates the monolithic `aic_world.xml` into `aic_robot.xml` (robot bodies, actuators, sensors), `aic_world.xml` (environment, task board, cable), and `scene.xml` (top-level file that includes both).
- **Adds motor actuators:** Inserts position-controlled actuators for all 6 UR5e joints and the Robotiq gripper finger joints.
- **Adds gripper mimic joint:** Couples the right finger to the left finger via an equality constraint (removing the redundant right finger motor).
- **Adds FT sensor:** Attaches force and torque sensors to the `AtiForceTorqueSensor` site.
- **Adds `gripper_tcp` site:** Inserts a tool-center-point site at the gripper tip for policy use.
- **Fixes robot quaternions:** Normalizes near-identity and noisy quaternions on robot links (e.g., `shoulder_link`, `upper_arm_link`, `wrist_*_link`) to clean values.
- **Configures cameras:** Adds orientation (`quat`), field of view (`fovy`), and resolution to the center/left/right cameras.
- **Configures the cable plugin:** Activates `mujoco.elasticity.cable`, sets twist/bend stiffness, adds joint damping, and attaches the plugin to all cable bodies.
- **Reparents cable link_1:** Moves `link_1` from `cable_end_0` to `cable_connection_0` with a computed relative pose (required for correct cable attachment).
- **Tunes cable physics:** Reduces cable body inertias from `0.01` to `1e-6`, sets `cable_connection_1` (SC plug end) inertia to `4e-4`, adds damping to `joint_connection_end_0`, and lifts `cable_end_0` by 5cm.
- **Adds weld constraint:** Welds the LC plug to the gripper tool link (`ati/tool_link`) with a tuned relative pose.
- **Adds contact exclusions:** Prevents self-collision between `tabletop`↔`shoulder_link`, gripper fingers, `sc_port`↔`sc_plug`, and `cable_end_0`↔`link_1`.
- **Partitions assets:** Assigns meshes, materials, and textures to the correct file (robot vs. world) based on keyword matching.

Make sure you run this without sourcing the ROS 2 workspace in a new terminal (use a virtual env as necessary):

  ```bash
  cd ~/ws_aic/src/aic/aic_utils/aic_mujoco/
  python3 scripts/add_cable_plugin.py --input mjcf/aic_world.xml --output mjcf/aic_world.xml --robot_output mjcf/aic_robot.xml --scene_output mjcf/scene.xml
  cd ~/ws_aic && colcon build --packages-select aic_mujoco
  ```
  - `--input`: Path to the initial MJCF world file (usually `aic_world.xml`).
  - `--output`: Path for the final world file (`aic_world.xml`).
  - `--robot_output`: Path for the robot-only file (`aic_robot.xml`).
  - `--scene_output`: Path for the scene file (`scene.xml`).



#### 6. View in MuJoCo

At this point you can view the generated scene in MuJoCo **without** any ROS 2 control setup. Comment out the following lines from the `aic_world.xml` before running the viewer:

```
 <equality>
    <weld body1="ati/tool_link" body2="lc_plug_link" relpose="-0.000711 0.001759 0.168213 0.577301 0.816105 -0.021418 -0.015395" solref="0.002 1" solimp="0.99 0.999 0.001"/>
 </equality>
 ```


The weld constraint forces the robot end effector ati/tool_link to mate with the lc_plug_link. When we start the mujoco viewer as a standalone application, the ROS2 controller that enforces the initial condition of the robot is not present. The robot is spawned much farther away and you will observe flickering caused by the weld constraint. You should see both the wire and the robot collapse under gravity. ** Make sure you uncomment this line after testing this step. **


##### Using pixi environment

The Python viewer starts in **paused mode by default**. Press Space to start/pause simulation.

```bash
# Enter pixi shell
pixi shell

# Option 1: Launch empty viewer (then drag and drop scene.xml into the window)
python -m mujoco.viewer

# Option 2: Use the provided convenience script (starts paused)
cd ~/ws_aic
python src/aic/aic_utils/aic_mujoco/scripts/view_scene.py ~/aic_mujoco_world/scene.xml

# Option 3: Use a one-liner Python command (paused mode)
python -c "import mujoco, mujoco.viewer; m = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path('~/aic_mujoco_world/scene.xml'); d = mujoco.MjData(m); v = mujoco.viewer.launch_passive(m, d); v.sync(); exec('while v.is_running(): v.sync()')"
```

> **Tip:** Press Space in the viewer to start/pause simulation, Backspace to reset.

##### Using the `simulate` binary

> **Note:** The `simulate` binary is provided by `mujoco_vendor`, which is built in [Part 2](#part-2-mujoco-with-ros-2-control). If you have already completed Part 2, you can also use:

```bash
simulate ~/ws_aic/src/aic/aic_utils/aic_mujoco/mjcf/scene.xml
```

---

## Part 2: MuJoCo with ROS 2 Control

![](../../../media/wave_arm_policy_mujoco.gif)

MuJoCo's integration with `ros2_control` allows you to control the UR5e robot using the same `aic_controller` interface as in Gazebo, ensuring your policy code remains simulator-agnostic.

### Installation Steps

> **Note:** If you already imported dependencies via `mujoco.repos` in the [Import MuJoCo Dependencies](#import-mujoco-dependencies) step above, the repositories are already cloned. Continue with the steps below to install and build.

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for the MuJoCo packages:

```bash
cd ~/ws_aic
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kilted -yr --skip-keys "gz-cmake3 DART libogre-dev libogre-next-2.3-dev"
```

#### 2. Build the Workspace

```bash
cd ~/ws_aic
source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash

# Build all packages (including aic_mujoco)
GZ_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --merge-install --symlink-install --packages-ignore lerobot_robot_aic
```

#### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Source the workspace (if not already done)
source ~/ws_aic/install/setup.bash

# Check MUJOCO_DIR is automatically set by the environment hook
echo $MUJOCO_DIR
# Should output something like:
# /home/user/ws_aic/install/opt/mujoco_vendor

# Check MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH is set (this is how MuJoCo finds plugins)
echo $MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH
# Should output something like:
# /home/user/ws_aic/install/opt/mujoco_vendor/lib

# Check MuJoCo installation directory
ls $MUJOCO_DIR
# Should show: bin, include, lib, share, simulate directories

# Check that plugin libraries are installed
ls $MUJOCO_DIR/lib/*.so
# Should show: libelasticity.so, libactuator.so, libsensor.so, libsdf_plugin.so, libmujoco.so*

# Verify MuJoCo simulate binary works
which simulate
# Should output:
# /home/user/ws_aic/install/opt/mujoco_vendor/bin/simulate
```

> **⚠️ Important:** If you have a previous MuJoCo installation, it may conflict with `mujoco_vendor`. Check for and remove any existing `MUJOCO_PATH`, `MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH`, or `MUJOCO_DIR` environment variables from your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) before building. After cleaning the environment, restart your shell and rebuild the workspace:
> ```bash
> # Check for conflicting environment variables
> env | grep MUJOCO
>
> # If you see MUJOCO_PATH or MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH pointing to a different location,
> # remove those exports from ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc) and restart shell
>
> # Then rebuild mujoco_vendor
> cd ~/ws_aic
> colcon build --packages-select mujoco_vendor --cmake-clean-cache
> source install/setup.bash
>
> # Verify the correct MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH is set
> echo $MUJOCO_PLUGIN_PATH
> # Should point to: /home/user/ws_aic/install/opt/mujoco_vendor/lib
> ```

### Launching MuJoCo with ros2_control

The `aic_mujoco_bringup.launch.py` launch file starts MuJoCo simulation with ros2_control, loading the same controllers as the Gazebo simulation.

#### Basic Launch Example

```bash
# terminal 1: Start the Zenoh router if not already running
source ~/ws_aic/install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp
export ZENOH_CONFIG_OVERRIDE='transport/shared_memory/enabled=true'
ros2 run rmw_zenoh_cpp rmw_zenohd
```

```bash
# terminal 2: Launch MuJoCo simulation with ros2_control
source ~/ws_aic/install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp
export ZENOH_CONFIG_OVERRIDE='transport/shared_memory/enabled=true'
ros2 launch aic_mujoco aic_mujoco_bringup.launch.py
```

The robot can now be teleoperated using the `aic_teleoperation` package. See the [teleoperation](../../docs/teleoperation.md) section for details. For cartesian teleop use:

```bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp 
export ZENOH_CONFIG_OVERRIDE='transport/shared_memory/enabled=false' 
source ~/ws_aic/install/setup.bash
ros2 run aic_teleoperation cartesian_keyboard_teleop
```

Any of the policies in `aic_example_policies` can be used to control the robot in MuJoCo. See the [example policies](../../docs/example_policies.md) section for details.
