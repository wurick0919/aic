# Scene Description

![](../../media/aic_scene.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes you've completed the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide and have a running evaluation environment.

The simulation environment is defined in the [`aic_description`](./../aic_description) package and comprises a robot, a task board, and various objects required for the cable insertion task. All 3D models for the scene are stored in the [`aic_assets`](./../aic_assets) package.

## Scene Components

### Robot

The challenge utilizes a **Universal Robots UR5e** robotic arm, equipped with the following hardware:
* **Gripper:** **Robotiq Hand-E**
* **Force-Torque Sensor:** **ATI AXIA80-M20**
* **Camera:** **Basler acA2440-20gc** with **Edmunds lens 58-000** (Resolution: 1152x1024, Frame Rate: 20 FPS)

* **Configuration:** The robot's physical properties and setup are defined in the [`ur_gz.urdf.xacro`](../aic_description/urdf/ur_gz.urdf.xacro) file.
* **Control:** The robot is operated via the `aic_controller`. For detailed interface and usage instructions, please refer to the [AIC Controller documentation](./aic_controller.md).

### Task Board

The core component of the challenge is the task board, defined in [`task_board.urdf.xacro`](../aic_description/urdf/task_board.urdf.xacro). This modular platform hosts various mounts, connectors, and modules required for the tasks.

**Key Components:**
* **Connectors:** Standard fiber optic connectors including SC and SFP types.
* **NIC Cards:** Network Interface Cards.
* **Mounts:** Specialized fixtures for securing the connectors and modules.

See [Task Board Description](./task_board_description.md) for detailed specifications.

### Environment

The global simulation settings—including lighting, physics properties, and general world setup—are defined in the [`aic.sdf`](../aic_description/world/aic.sdf) file.

## Exploring the Environment

Now that you have the basic environment running, you can explore different configurations to understand the challenge better and create diverse training scenarios.

> [!TIP]
> See this guide on how to [navigate the scene in Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/gui/#the-scene).

### Customizing the Environment

You can customize the simulation environment by passing parameters to the launch command. Whether you're using the **eval container** or a **source build**, the parameters are the same.

**In the eval container (via distrobox):**
```bash
/entrypoint.sh [parameters]
```

**From source build:**
```bash
ros2 launch aic_bringup aic_gz_bringup.launch.py [parameters]
```

> [!TIP]
> To check if your current terminal is inside the eval container:
> ```bash
> echo $CONTAINER_ID  # Should output: aic_eval
> ```

### Example: Custom Task Board Configuration

Here's a complete example spawning a task board with various components:

```bash
spawn_task_board:=true \
    task_board_x:=0.3 task_board_y:=-0.1 task_board_z:=1.2 \
    task_board_roll:=0.0 task_board_pitch:=0.0 task_board_yaw:=0.785 \
    sfp_mount_rail_0_present:=true sfp_mount_rail_0_translation:=-0.08 \
    sc_mount_rail_0_present:=true sc_mount_rail_0_translation:=-0.09 \
    nic_card_mount_0_present:=true nic_card_mount_0_translation:=0.005 \
    sc_port_0_present:=true sc_port_0_translation:=-0.04 \
    spawn_cable:=true cable_type:=sfp_sc_cable attach_cable_to_gripper:=true \
    ground_truth:=true start_aic_engine:=false
```

**Key parameters for exploration:**
- `ground_truth:=true` - Enables ground truth TF frames for easier debugging during development
- `start_aic_engine:=false` - Disables automatic trial orchestration so you can freely explore
- `spawn_task_board:=true` - Spawns the task board immediately
- `spawn_cable:=true` - Spawns a cable in the scene
- `attach_cable_to_gripper:=true` - Attaches the cable to the gripper
- `cable_type:=sfp_sc_cable` - Type of cable (options: `sfp_sc_cable`, `sfp_sc_cable_reversed`)

For the complete list of configurable parameters, see the [aic_bringup README](../aic_bringup/README.md).

### Creating Training Scenarios

**Generate diverse training environments** by varying the parameters:

1. **Launch with different configurations** to create randomized scenarios
2. **The complete world state is automatically saved** to `/tmp/aic.sdf` after spawning
3. **Copy the file to preserve multiple scenarios:**
   ```bash
   cp /tmp/aic.sdf ~/training_scenarios/scenario_001.sdf
   ```
4. **Import into other simulators** like IsaacLab or MuJoCo for training

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Scenario 1: NIC card in slot 2
/entrypoint.sh spawn_task_board:=true nic_card_mount_2_present:=true \
    spawn_cable:=true cable_type:=sfp_sc_cable ground_truth:=true start_aic_engine:=false
cp /tmp/aic.sdf ~/training_scenarios/nic_slot_2.sdf

# Scenario 2: SC connector on right rail with different pose
/entrypoint.sh spawn_task_board:=true task_board_yaw:=1.57 \
    sc_mount_rail_1_present:=true spawn_cable:=true ground_truth:=true start_aic_engine:=false
cp /tmp/aic.sdf ~/training_scenarios/sc_right_rotated.sdf
```

### Programmatic Entity Spawning

For training workflows that need to spawn or respawn entities (task boards, cables), the `/expand_xacro` service lets you expand xacro templates from model-side code without direct filesystem access to the eval environment.
The following launch file includes the standard `aic_bringup` Gazebo stack along with the training utils:

```bash
ros2 launch aic_training_utils aic_training_gz_bringup.launch.py

# spawn the task board
ros2 service call /expand_xacro aic_training_interfaces/srv/ExpandXacro \
  "{package_name: 'aic_description', relative_path: 'urdf/task_board.urdf.xacro', \
    xacro_arguments: ['ground_truth:=true', 'nic_card_mount_0_present:=true']}"
```

The returned XML can then be passed to `/gz_server/spawn_entity` to spawn entities at arbitrary poses. Combined with `/gz_server/delete_entity`, this enables per-episode scene randomization (varying task board poses, rail positions, cable types, etc.) entirely from your training code.

Inside the eval container, this can be started with `distrobox enter`:
```bash
distrobox enter aic_eval -- bash -lc '
  source /ws_aic/install/setup.bash &&
  ros2 launch aic_training_utils aic_training_gz_bringup.launch.py \
    spawn_task_board:=true \
    spawn_cable:=true \
    nic_card_mount_2_present:=true
'
```

### Teleoperation

**Teleoperate the robot** in joint-space or Cartesian-space to:
- Explore the workspace
- Test cable insertion manually
- Understand the robot's reach and limitations
- Practice with and without cable attached

Before teleoperating, we recommend reading the [AIC Controller Guide](./aic_controller.md) to understand the controller used in the challenge.

See the [Robot Teleoperation Guide](../aic_utils/aic_teleoperation/README.md) for detailed instructions.

When using teleoperation to collect training data, be sure to tare the Force/Torque sensors at the start of each training episode. See [Taring before Training](#Taring-before-training).

> [!TIP]
> If the robot can't seem to move when it's near an object, it might be in collision with that object even though it's not touching. To view the collision mesh for an object, right-click on it, click `View >`, and then `Collisions`.

## Exporting World State for AI Training

The simulation includes a world plugin that automatically exports the complete world state after all entities (robot, task board, cable) are spawned. This feature is particularly useful for AI policy training and cross-platform simulation workflows.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Reproducible Scenarios:** Capture randomized configurations created via launch parameters for consistent training environments.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Import the exported SDF file into other simulators like IsaacLab or MuJoCo.
- **Training Data Generation:** Create diverse training scenarios by varying launch parameters and exporting each configuration.

**Export Details:**
- **Default Location:** `/tmp/aic.sdf`
- **Plugin Configuration:** Defined in [`aic.sdf`](../aic_description/world/aic.sdf) with parameters:
  - `<save_world_path>`: Path where the world file is saved (default: `/tmp/aic.sdf`)
  - `<save_world_delay_s>`: Delay in simulation seconds before exporting (default: `0.0`)

> [!NOTE]
> **MuJoCo Integration:** The AIC environment supports exporting and training policies natively in MuJoCo. Exported scenarios can be converted to MJCF format and run with the same ROS 2 control interfaces used in Gazebo. For detailed instructions on simulation setup, converting Gazebo worlds, and using `ros2_control` in MuJoCo, see the [MuJoCo Integration Guide](../aic_utils/aic_mujoco/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Isaac Lab Integration:** The AIC environment can also be loaded in NVIDIA's Isaac Lab for data collection and training. For details, see the [Isaac Lab Integration Guide](../aic_utils/aic_isaac/README.md).

## Taring before Training

At the start of each training episode (i.e. before teleoperation and before spawning any cables in the environment), ensure that the Force/Torque Sensor (F/T Sensor) is tared using the following service call:
```bash
ros2 service call /aic_controller/tare_force_torque_sensor std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```
